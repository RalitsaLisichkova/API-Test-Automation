End-to-end API testing using Rest Assured involves testing the entire API workflow from start to finish. This includes sending requests to the API endpoints, validating the responses, and ensuring that the data is being transferred correctly between the client and the server. Rest Assured is a Java library that simplifies API testing by providing a domain-specific language for writing test cases. It allows testers to easily set up requests, extract data from responses, and perform assertions to validate the API behavior.
